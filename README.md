In this group project, I collaborated with team members to perform predictive analysis on Conagra's internal data, focusing on deriving actionable insights for the meat substitute market segment. By applying advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques, we identified trends and patterns that informed strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing the company's market share and driving growth in this competitive sector.

Our findings were tailored to address specific business challenges and opportunities within the meat substitute industry, supporting decision-making at the executive level.

However, due to a confidentiality agreement with Conagra, we are unable to share the dataset or the code used in this analysis for external purposes. This project exemplifies my expertise in predictive analysis and highlights my ability to work collaboratively in a team to leverage data-driven insights that support business strategy in a real-world context.
